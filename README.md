# IRIS IN
Teaching myself React basics via forcing myself to take it easy and make the most barebones application possible. This was a test of patience, mainly. It's meant to let the user add to a list of items (in my case, songs) and then press a button to randomly pick one. Trying to teach myself how to plan component usage, animations, and designs better.
